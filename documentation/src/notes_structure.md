# Structure

```latex
data/
source/
├── latex/
├── courses/
├── pages/
├── snippets/
└── universes/
```

The `latex/` folder contains all the `.tex` files for the PDF Stellar Format files.
Even though pages and snippets can already be generated from PDFs,
the `pages/` and `snippets/` are a place to put manually crafted snippets and pages.

# PDF Stellar Format

Stellar is able to interpret special PDFs with certain text commands written on the page. This is referred to as `PDF Stellar Format`.
The file contains a full stellar page and snippets or just a collection of snippets. Stellar will crop the PDF into multiple pieces to generate every snippet individually, and is also able to generate the corresponding page containing them.

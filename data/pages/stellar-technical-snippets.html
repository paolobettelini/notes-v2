<h1>Snippets</h1>

Snippets are the most basic units of contents.
A snippet may be just an image, some text, a mathematical expression,
a mathematical theorem or proof, an animation or an interactive animation.

<h2>Snippet structure</h2>

Any snippet is a folder, named as the identifier of the snippet,
containing the content to display.
The main snippet file is also named as its identifier and has one of the supported
extensions.
<br>
<br>
Supported extensions are: <b>html</b>, <b>pdf</b>, <b>png (TODO)</b>.
<br>
Examples:
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>snippets/</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>some-snippet-id-1</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>some-snippet-id-1.html</b></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>some-snippet-id-2</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>some-snippet-id-2.pdf</b></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Complementary files</h2>

A folder for a snippet may multiple multiple files.
The main file may request the contents of the complementary files.

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>snippets/</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>some-snippet/</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>some-snippet.html</b></li>
                    <li><b>complementary1.html</b></li>
                    <li><b>complementary2.html</b></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

The main file <b>some-snippet.html</b> can request
the file <b>complementary1.html</b> by the the following uri:
<b><pre>/snippet/some-snippet/complementary1<id></pre></b>
If a complementary file wants to request another complementary file (E.g. <b>complementary2</b>),
it is sufficient to request the URI <b><pre>./complementary2</pre></b>.

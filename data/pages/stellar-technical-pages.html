<h1>Pages</h1>

Snippets can be organized into pages.

<h2>Page structure</h2>

A page is a simple <b>html</b> file.
Pages can contain any HTML content and include snippets.
<br>
Pages can contain content like text and explanations.
Is it important to note that the same snippet can be included by multiple pages,
so if something is worth sharing throughout pages, it is worth to create a snippet for it.

Examples:
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>pages/</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>page1.html</b></li>
            <li><b>page2.html</b></li>
            <li><b>page3.html</b></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Special tags</h2>

The tag
<code>
<pre>
&lt;snippet&gt;id&lt;/snippet&gt;
</pre>
</code> lets you include a snippet in the page.

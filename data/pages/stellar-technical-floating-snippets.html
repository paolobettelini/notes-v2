<h1>Floating snippets (work in progress)</h1>

It is possible to create links to snippets that will display the snippet 
when the mouse is over them.

<h2>HTML</h2>

If you're writing HTML for a page or a snippet, you can embed a floating snippet link
as follows
<code>
<pre>
    &lt;ref snippet="snippet-id"&gt;link text&lt;/ref&gt;
</pre>
</code>

<h2>LaTeX</h2>

If you're writing a snippet using LaTex, you can embed a floating snippet link
as follows

<code>
<pre>
    \snippetref{snippet-name}{link text}
</pre>
</code>

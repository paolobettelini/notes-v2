# Stellar

Welcome to `stellar`. Stellar is a framework to build organized courses or notes.
There are many different ways to use stellar.
If you want to see an example of this framework being used,
check out my [notes](https://github.com/paolobettelini/notes) repository,
which is extensively based on LaTex and contains (interactive) animations or 3D models.

Check out the <b>[documentation](https://paolobettelini.github.io/stellar)</b>!

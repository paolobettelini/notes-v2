# Nannou WASM
Here you can find some examples of animations/interactive animations using nannou.

## Compile
```bash
cd website
wasm-pack build [--debug]
npm install
npm run install
```
You can now serve the `dist/` folder.
If you want to package the animation into a snippet see the documentation (TODO).
